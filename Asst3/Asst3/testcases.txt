TEST CASES :

	This file contains a more thorough set of test cases for our program with the expected
	output as a result of executing that command. These command outputs are the expected outcome
	IF the only commands that were run were these commands applied in this linear fashion.
	By this, we mean that the expected output for 'Commit' here is dependant on the previous
	commands (add), create, etc

	Commmands To Test : 'configure’, ‘checkout’, ‘update’, ‘upgrade’, ‘commit’, 
		            ‘push’, 'create', ‘destroy’, ‘add’, ‘remove’, 
			    ‘currentversion’, ‘history’, and ‘rollback.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

STARTING SERVER : ./WTFserver 9000
	EXPECTED SERVER OUTPUT : Server should output the message "WTF Server Started" if the
			         port number was valid and was within the bounds of 0 - 65535



CONFIGURE : ./WTF configure 127.0.0.1 9000
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Client Was Successfully Configured"



CREATE : ./WTF create xxx
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "A New Project Was Created With The Name 'xxx'"



ADD : ./WTF add xxx 1.txt
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Successfully Added '1.txt' To 'xxx'."
   			  The client-side manifest would then have an entry added containing that files version number, name, and hash.



REMOVE ./WTF remove xxx 1.txt
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Removed '1.txt' From 'xxx'."
   			  The client-side manifest would then have an entry removed that containing that files version number, name, and hash.



COMMIT : ./WTF commit xxx
	AT THIS POINT, let's say that we have NOT done the remove action on 'xxx'... Which means that the manifest WOULD contain 1.txt's entry ONLY.
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Starting Commit...
			  	A ./xxx/1.txt
			   Sending The Server The Commit File...
			   Commit Completed Successfully."



COMMIT : ./WTF push xxx
	EXPECTED OUTPUT (If Project Name Exists) : "Starting Push...
						    Sending The Server The .Commit File.
						   .Commit Succesfully Sent To Server.
						    Sending The Server '1.txt' (THIS WOULD BE WHATEVER FILE IS REQUESTED)
						    Server Completed Push"



CURRENTVERSION : ./WTF currentversion xxx
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Project Version #1
			  	./xxx/1.txt (Version #1)
			  |   END OF CURRENT VERSION REPORT   |"



ROLLBACK : ./WTF rollback xxx 0
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Server Completed Rollback To Version #0"



UPDATE : ./WTF update xxx
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "	D ./xxx/1.txt
			  Project Updated."
	  


UPGRADE : ./WTF upgrade xxx
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "Deleted 1.txt."



HISTORY : ./WTF history xxx
	EXPECTED OUTPUT : "The Project Requested Does Not Have A Commit History."
	(This makes sense as we have just rolled back to version zero... where no commits have been completed yet. This version is a fresh copy of the project).




DESTROY : ./WTF destroy xxx
	EXPECTED SERVER OUTPUT :
		"Client Requested DESTROY
			Destroying './xxx/.Manifest'.
			Destroying './xxx/.Commit'.
				...(Continuing with each file... too many to list)
		 Destroyed Project 'xxx'"
